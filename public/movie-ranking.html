  <h1>TOP 3 MOVIES OF ALL TIME</h1>
  <h2>According to Aaron</h2>

  <div class="movie">
    <h3>Interstellar</h3>
    <p>Watching this movie gives me a sense of euphoria that cannot be expressed in any other movie that I have watched. It has such thrilling peices of scenery and the plot above anything else is S-Tier comapring it to similar movies. Overall my favorite pick of all time. I tend to go back and watch this movie just because I was in the mood to do so!</p>

  <div class="movie">
    <h3>Batman: The Dark Knight Rises</h3>
    <p>This movie is wonderful. It's one of the best movies to watch when feeling bored because the plot keeps you engaged, especially due to the outstanding acting. From all the cast from Heath Ledger to the person who played Batmans interest it was overall great.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="movie">
    <h3>The Big Short</h3>
    <p>This movie shows how the great collapse of 2008 was ignored by most people, and that if someone just looked, this incident would've been at least acknowledged. The movie depicts this and everything that happened during that time.</p>
